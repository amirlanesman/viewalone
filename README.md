# WatchAlone

WatchAlone chrome extension helps you get the video streams requested by any chrome tab so that you can watch them outside the page.  
It also catches urls with `.mp4` and `.m3u8` extensions to view in-browser. You can always use the *Download* button inside of chrome built-in video to download such a file.
